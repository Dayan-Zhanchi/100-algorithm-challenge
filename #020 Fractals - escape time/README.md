# Fractal Mandelbrot set - escape time algorithm
I used the [escape time algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) to color each pixel in the
image below. The formula is fairly simple, where it iteratively builds on itself and escapes at a certain condition described 
in the article, hence where the name comes from. The logic for coloring the pixels was taken from [codingame](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/2358/how-to-plot-the-mandelbrot-set/adding-some-colors).
