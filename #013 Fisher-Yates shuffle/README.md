# Fisher-Yates shuffle
This version of [Fisher-Yates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle) is the modern variant, which
can be found under the section "the modern algorithm" in the link. It performs faster at O(n), whereas the original version
performs at O(n^2). Nevertheless a very simple algorithm to implement despite the cool name.
