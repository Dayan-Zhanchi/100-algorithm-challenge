# 100-algorithm-challenge
Read the [article](https://medium.com/100-days-of-algorithms/100-days-of-algorithms-challenge-41996f7e1ec8) about implementing 100 algorithms and going give it a try by implementing 100 algorithms 
of my own choice. The intent of doing this challenge is to feel a sense of pride and achievement ;). But most importantly
to familiarize myself with popular algorithms and learn new algorithms.
