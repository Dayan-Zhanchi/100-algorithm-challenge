# Sudoku solver with backtracking
The [Sudoku algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku_solving_algorithms#Backtracking) is rather simple, it uses a brute force approach by trying all combinations of digits on the Sudoku grid 
and backtracks whenever a candidate solution doesn't satisfy the given constraints i.e the rules of Sudoku.
