# Bipartiteness of graph
Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph

This implementation is for the 2-bipartiteness case, where we only try to color all the nodes in 2 different colors. 
If there aren't any nodes in the graph that has an adjacent node with the same color as itself, then the graph is said to
be bipartite.
